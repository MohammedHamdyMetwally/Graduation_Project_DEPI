# Graduation_Project_DEPI
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Campus Area Network (CAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. Through this simulation, various networking components such as switches, routers, VLANs, and subnetting have been configured to ensure efficient data communication across the campus. The network design emphasizes scalability, security, and high performance, providing a robust infrastructure suitable for a large-scale environment like a university campus. This project serves as a foundation for further network automation and advanced configurations, showcasing practical skills in network design and Cisco technologies.
